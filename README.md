# Unnamed Music App
### WARNING: this project isn't really fully complete
It was made mostly for fun and it has glaring flaws like... the music app actually not being able to play music.
Also isn't really responsive, you gotta fiddle around a bit with the scale for it to display properly on higher resolutions. 
I might update it in the future if I want to.

## Current Features: 
- Songs, albums and 'genre mixes' drawn dynamically from a json file
- Searching filters results based on album/genre name
- Progress bar reflecting how long the song actually is
- Switching songs, pausing and playing with some clean animations
- Playlist showing songs in album and the currently playing song, also allows you to switch songs
- Cool dynamically generated gradients in the genres section
