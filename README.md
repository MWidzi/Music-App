# Unnamed Music App
### WARNING: this project isn't really fully complete
It was made mostly for fun and it has glaring flaws like... the music app actually not being able to play music.
I might update it in the future if I want to

## Current Features: 
- Songs, albums and 'genre mixes' drawn dynamically from a json file
- Searching filters results based on album/genre name
- Progress bar reflecting how long the song actually is
- Switching songs, pausing and playing with some clean animations
- Playlist showing songs in album and the currently playing song, also allows you to switch songs
- Cool dynamically generated gradients in the genres section
